# Admin Meeting 9/2/18

### Primary goal

a. Roger: Provide a free and open forum for facilitating interactions between those involved in the community of Engineering House

b. Nick: To promote and ease communication between all members in the Engineering House community
  
c. Nick: Can we add something from our actual mission statement? Since that describes what we want to be as a floor. 
     
- Roger: This makes it look like members would be mandated to be in channels
	
	- Ray: We could have required channels
- Kel: Off floor aren't necessarily bound by the constitution, since they didn't have to sign it, so how can they be bound to follow the discord version?
		- Roger: They agree to abide when they join the server
- Nick: We should condense this all to one. I am not a huge fan of "free and open", because that means that people can spam
- Roger: That is not what free means, it means we will not censor specific ideas
- Bench: So change it to "We will not censor specific ideas"
- Roger: But what if there is a freshman that is a neo-nazi
  - How about we say: "We will not support violence or hate"

### Discussion

- Roger: The discord should not be an official house resource. 
- Leiah: It is advertised as the "The Engineering House Discord", and it uses our constitution picture
- Bench: It is on the Facebook page as "the Engineering House discord", it is hard to argue that it isn't a house resource
- Roger: Right now, there is minimal liability if something gets fucked. Right now, Ray, Ben and I are most at risk if something gets fucked. 
- Roger: I believe that there should be separation of admin powers, because if Leiah gets impeached, she shouldn't censor people talking about it. 
	- Leiah: people under impeachment are removed from admin status
		- Ray: We can put that in the constitution
- Be careful of censorship from cabinet and EBoard (reference Joe Strinka)

- We took a look at a discord exchange about the IEEE coup, and things that Joe said that EBoard didn't like. 
	
- Kel: We shouldn't be allowed to disallow people from discussing things we personally disagree with
- Ben: This isn't what's happening, this was EBoard said it wouldn't be an event, and people continued discussing it, spamming everyone. 
- Roger: Mia shouldn't have said what she said. EBoard should have raised the situation to the admins, and the admins should have delivered the message. 
- Ben: This wasn't something that admins should have decided, this was EBoard and cabinet's decision. 
	- Something about "cursed images" from Alex, and how EBoard banned them from public forums. 
- Roger: We should have rigorous definitions of dissent and spam 
- Ben: They shouldn't have kept on messaging, they were just mad they lost the fight
- Roger: Dissent should never me moderated
- Ben: There is a fine line between dissent and spam, they crossed it into spam
- R: If more people agreed, would you think it wasn't spam?
- B: No, because they were bitching in a public forum, after cabinet had put a stop to it. There is a fine line between dissent and bitching, they were bitching. 
- Leiah: I would rather be bitched at in person, because over discord it just gets annoying. 
- Saty: You can analogize this to a twitch stream, there are trolls, but they get moderated. 
- Bench: To get onto the discord, will you need to sign the constitution?
- Ray: We will put the constitution in the description of #ask_an_admin, and make them say a specific phrase or key word, saying that they have read. 
- Roger: I have seen in other servers that they have "password" channels, where when they put a phrase in a channel, and then it automatically gives you perms.
- Roger: Propaganda in the discord?
- Leiah: No
- Roger: Dante posted one, but it wasn't in promotion of Seth
- Ben: I think that we can use propaganda as memes _after_ the election. No prop during the election to promote candidates. 
  - Should we have a channel for old prop to have a record of old stuff?

Howie: What's going on Here?

  - Seth, Ray: Admin meeting

### User Rules

#### Discussion

- Roger: Let's start with outline what they _can't do_. 
- Bench: Don't be a dick. Never go _full dick_
- Nick: Don't have malful (malicious, Nick is tired) intent when speaking. 
- Bench: What _is_ hate speech?
  - Roger: Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. 
    - Because I am a liberal fuck wad, we should respect pronouns. 
- Should we ban cursed images?
	- No, you can't really ban a meme
- Saty: There should be exceptions for screenshots? In case someone posts fucking child porn.
- Bench: Change the "offending text" to "offending post". Add exception for illegal content
- Roger: We should mention that, even though there is an NSFW channel, still use discretion, too offensive things will be removed. 
- Roger: What defines NSFW? What's the difference between NSFW and NSFL?
	- excessive gore?
	- Ray: This is too subjective, just admin discretion
- Saty: We don't need a clause saying to keep discussion in the appropriate channel, and have an NSFW clause. 

##### Consequences

- Points system, every time they fuck up, they get a point. 
- If they build up enough points, they get kicked off. 
- Bench: I think we should use campus groups to do reservations
	- Leiah: Only admins can make events on CampusGroups
- Keep track of points in a google sheet, not a bot since we shouldn't rely on a bot for our core functionality.
- A major offense is a number of minor offenses. 
- Points will be added for major infractions
- Minor infractions will be met with three warnings, after which they will be counted as major offenses 
- Points will decrement at a rate of one per week

- ***Scrapping the points idea...***
- There is a list of bannable offenses. Users will not post illegal content. 
- Users will not violate federal, state or local law.
- Roger: How do we handle week 0 spoilers?
	- Nick: Second Years and alums just shouldn't be stupid. 
- Ben: ***NOT CAMPO, PUBLIC SAFETY***
- Should we have the "break constitution" a bannable offense? Since off floors don't _have_ to abide
	- Bench: Will cabinet get banned from discord if they don't pay cabinet dues. 
- Duration of bans?
	- Depending on the severity of infraction
	- There will be some permabans (aka things like child porn)
- First major infraction: Warning and removal of post as documented below. 
- Second major infraction: Remove verified role for minimum of 24 hours. 
- Third: Removal of verified role for a week, and potential removal of server. 
- Before removal from server, or _officially_ banning them, the admins will speak with the user, either in person, or if in person is not possible: voice chat. This way the user can have a defense, and they can discuss with the admins to find a solution. The members of this discussion will be the user in question, the Vice President, and at least two admins. 
- Bannable offenses will be met with an immediate ban from the Engineering House discord with a duration of at least a year as well as reporting the user on Discord.

### BREAK FOR BREAKFAST BURRITOS

# Continuation of Life

- Roger: A lot of this is contingent upon whether discord is a house resource
- Bench: I think that discord should be viewed similar to Tremblant, EHousers do it, but it isn't a thing that _ehouse does_. 
- Kel: I think that there could be some liability, partially because of reservations channel.
- Nick: I think that it is a house resource. On the note of tremblant, we can _honestly_ play off that it is just a group of friends. 
- Leiah: As it stands now, you could not convince me that it isn't a house resource. 
- Roger: Could we have something like ALC? Have people that act as a relay between admins and house. How does the unholy trinity's power work, since we weren't appointed?
- Kel: the trinity seems to do more of the moderating, and you guys seem like you have more power than EBoard on the server, since you do more moderation than EBoard does. I wouldn't appoint anyone else to your level of power.
- Roger: What should we do with server owner status?
- Leiah: I would like the computer chairman to "own" the server.
- Nick: We should just make a computer chairman account, that doesn't actually get touched, but is just there to _own_ the server. The current CC would just use their personal account. 
- EBoard will just be given "moderator" status instead of admin status
- Selection of the new admins
  - New admins will be selected either when previous admins leave or when it is decided that more admins are necessary
  - freshmen will not be selected as admins during their first semester
  - those seeking to become admins must be interviewed by a board of at least three current admins
- Ben: "Babies" is a banned word on discord
- Admins shouldn't partake in channels that they are not a part of (alumni admins that are partaking in the #second_years). 
- Admins shouldn't change user nicknames unless explicitly asked, or the user's name isn't following the **Name (Major)** pattern. 
- Admins shouldn't create/delete roles/channels without discussion, unless they already fit under another role/channel
- Removing Seth's Scarlet letter as punishment?
  - Leiah: I'll remove it for puns
- When acting as a User, admins will not comment in channels that they would not be able to see without their admin status, unless it is for the purpose of moderation. 
  - Admins will have the same responsibilities is regular users. 
- Channels for majors with less than 5 people are not required. 
  - creation of a major channel will be done at the request of a user in that major, if there are 5 users in that major. 
- Bots should never be relied upon
- Bots should always be tested before implementation
- Bots should only implemented after a unanimous admin vote
- Only bots with publicly viewable code should be used
- Kel: Bots can be spammy
- Leiah: Can we remove electro-magnetism?
- Bench: Can we get a process for bot removal?
